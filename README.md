1. Distributed Consensus Protocol Implementation and Evaluation
Objective: Implement and evaluate a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft or Paxos) and analyze its resilience to faults and security vulnerabilities.


Skills Covered:


C/C++/Rust programming to implement consensus protocols.
Security considerations: Explore vulnerabilities in consensus algorithms, such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) or node compromise.
Fault-tolerance evaluation: Assess how the system behaves under failures like network partitioning, node crashes, or malicious node behaviors.
Distributed systems understanding, focusing on ensuring system availability and maintaining data consistency despite faults.
Outcome:


A working implementation of a consensus algorithm with a focus on resilience and security.
Performance and fault-tolerance evaluations showing how well the system copes with different types of network failures or malicious attacks.
